This Kotlin code is for an Android app that suggests meals based on what time of day the user enters. It has an input field where the user types a time (like "Morning" or "Dinner"), a button to submit it, and a text view to display the result. There's also a reset button to reset the text result

When the user clicks the button, the app checks their input against a list of times like "Morning," "Afternoon," or "Mid-Morning." If there's a match, it displays a suggested meal (for example, "Breakfast: Eggs and Bacon"). If the input doesn't match any of the options, the app shows an error message telling the user to enter the right spelling.
